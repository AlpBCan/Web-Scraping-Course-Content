IT'S YOUR TURN!
Try to do this on your own. If you are stuck, take a look at the solution for that part and
come back to your code.


-Create a project named quotes

-Get into the project folder using terminal

-Create a spider called quotespider for website quotes.toscrape.com

-Open items.py, create a QuoteItem with fields; quote, author, tags and import this item in
the spider page

-Construct the parse function to get necessary data(Your program will start to scrape from
page 1 by default (starturls)):

-Create a list of quotes on the first page

-Start a loop in this list

        -For every loop create an instance of QuoteItem

        -From every quote on page, scrape quote text, author and tags
        (for tags, develop a logic to combine them in one string)
        HINT: you can use   ', '.join(tag_list)

        -Put them in the QuoteItem you created and yield this item

-Check if there is a next page

-If there is, make request to the next page using response.follow, use a callback function to
repeat the procedure above

-Run your spider from the terminal, use an expression to save the data to a json file
